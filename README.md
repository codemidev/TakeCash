                        i) we choosed GitHub over Gitlab cause github is free , Gitlab is premium

                        ii) Flutterwave over Paystack cause flutterwave has more easy to follow documentation

                         

                          

                           

                           # Reasons for Framework alternatives:

                           i) Ajax works fine for us

                           ii) Bootstrap is easier to implement cause of it's simple integration techniques.

                           iii) WordPress Over Nodejs cause WordPress is secure and has many plug and play features that can boost development and save time.
